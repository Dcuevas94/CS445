========================BEGIN DOC=========================
This project was done throughout the spring semester, summer 
and the past few weeks.

Initially using Test driven development (TDD) and 
then came down to crunching out as much code as possible.

A lot of functionality is missing, but the concepts would be 
the same had there been better planning from the start.

Shipments can be posted, but notes were not added.

Monthly Selection can also be returned, but none can be 
posted through rest, unless again hard coded.

Revenue was implemented then deleted, but without shipments or 
monthly selection working, it's useless to implement anyways.

==============HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT=======================
Run the make file, the default 'make' command runs the project
>make
when you finish running the project press enter and the http 
server will terminate itself.

Running on a fresh installation of Ubuntu will require updates
and installation of java, run the following command to automate
the process of installing them. Enter password as needed for root.
>make all

You can go into any of the following to GET the data
GET
http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/
http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/{aid}
http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/monthly_selection
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/{aid}
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/{uid}/shipments --Needs to exist
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/{wid}

POST
http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/{uid}/shipments --Needs to exist
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/{wid}


===================POSTING ITEMS========================
To post anything into admin, sub or wines.
use either Google Chrome or Firefox.

You can try posting via cli using curl, but it was not tested.

For Chrome, install the Postman - REST client 
For Firefox, install the Poster client.

Both do the same thing, but the GUI on chrome is easier to use.

Installing Chrome on Ubuntu with the following command:
>make chrome.

Overall, this was a fun/hard/tear jerking experience.
Installing on a fresh Ubuntu machine has been tested and running on
multiple attempts. Windows worked as well.
Otherwise, it works perfectly fine in my MacBook pro using eclipse 
to compile/execute the project and it also worked when compiling/executing
through the command line.

Please note that this project was done with Java 1.8 and some issues were found
when using Ubuntu's default java installation. mvn compile caused a few issues.

The following commands work in Ubuntu:
>man compile --Might cause issues
>mvn exec:java
>mvn test
>mvn cobertura:cobertura


========================SUMMARY=========================

Coverage html files can be found in the following directory
VIN-Cuevas/target/site/cobertura/frame-summary-edu.iit.cs445.VIN_Cuevas.html

packaging the project into a jar also worked on my MacBook Pro
did not work in Ubuntu and was removed from the project.

Approximately 85 hours were invested in this final version, 
including testing, implementing, planning and learning REST 
implementations and REST testing. 
About 20 hours have been invested in figuring out how to have the project
run properly in a fresh installation of Ubuntu.
Biggest challenge has been getting the project to work outside of a Mac OS X
and windows environment. For some reason it was significantly more challenging 
to run properly in Ubuntu than in either of the other OS's. Learning REST 
implementations were difficult for the first half hour, afterwards it was a breeze
to implement. Testing all the branches on a REST interface was difficult and time
consuming compared to all the other testing done.

Recommendations: Compared to previous projects, this one was significantly more 
complex and vague for the majority of the class. Less time should be spent on 
videos that can be viewed from home and more time on working through the 
complete requirements without any vagueness.
