========================BEGIN DOC=========================
This project was done throughout the summer and the past 
few weeks.

Initially using Test driven development (TDD) and 
then came down to crunching out as much code as possible.

A lot of functionallity is missing, but the concepts would be the same had there been better planning from the start.

Shipments cannot be posted, but if a shipment were 
hard coded it would be able to GET it.

MonthlySelection can also be returned, but none can be 
posted through rest, unless again hard coded.

Revenue was implemented then deleted, but without shipments or 
monthlyselection working, it's useless to imple

=======HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT=======
Run the make file, the default 'make' command runs the project
>make
when you finish running the project press enter and the http 
server will terminate itself.

You can go into any of the following to GET the data

http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/{aid}
http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/monthly_selection
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/{uid}

http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/{wid}

POST
http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/
http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/{uid}/shipments --Needs to exist
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/
http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/{wid}


=====POSTING ITEMS=====
To post anything into admin, sub or wines,
use your either Google Chrome or Firefox.

You can try posting via cli using curl, but it was not tested

for Chrome, install the Postman - REST clinet 
for FireFox, install the Poster client.

both do the same thing.

you can post an empty or a json admin || sub || wine
you can also retrieve those specific admin || sub || wine
by their ID which can be found after posting an item.
for admins:
	http://localhost:8080/vin/admin/{adminID}
for subscribers:
	http://localhost:8080/vin/sub/{subscriberID}
for wines:
	http://localhost:8080/vin/wines/{wineID}


overall, this was a fun/hard/tear jerking experience.
installing on a fresh ubuntu machine has been running on
multiple attempts. Windows worked as well.
Otherwise, it works perfectly fine in my Macbook pro using eclipse 
to compile/execute the project.
Also worked when compiling/executing through the command line.

flowwing commands work in ubuntu
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
mvn test
mvn cobertura:cobertura

Coverage html files can be found in the following directory
VIN-Cuevas/target/site/cobertura/frame-summary-edu.iit.cs445.VIN_Cuevas.html
or in the root directory.


packaging the project into a jar also worked on my Mackbook Pro
did not work in Ubuntu.
